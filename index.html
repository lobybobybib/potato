    <h2>Potato Facts</h2>
    <hr>

    <li><h4>Potatoes are mostly water!</h4></li>
    <p>Despite their starchy appearance, potatoes are actually made up of about 80% water! This surprising fact highlights just how much hydration is packed into this humble vegetable. The remaining 20% consists of solids, including carbohydrates, fiber, and essential nutrients. This high water content not only makes potatoes versatile in cooking but also contributes to their delightful texture when baked, mashed, or fried.</p>

    <li><h4>Potato comes from the Spanish word “Patata”</h4></li>
    <p>The vegetable’s existence is quite old age as its domestication dates approximately between 8000 and 5000 BC in Peru or Bolivia, known as the Andes back then. Still, its earliest verified tuber was found in 2500 BC at the Ancon coastal site and the Incas cultivated it as early as 1800 years ago.

    <h2>The History of the Potato</h2>
    <hr>
   
    <div class="potatoimg" style="height:220px;"> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT4IPpPNvVkSYnbm7G02CDBtRp1XN_cPPHX0g&s"> </div>
    
    <p>The potato was the first domesticated vegetable in the region of modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia between 8000 and 5000 BC. Cultivation of potatoes in South America may go back 10,000 years, but tubers do not preserve well in the archaeological record, making identification difficult. The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancón (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC. Aside from actual remains, the potato is also found in the Peruvian archaeological record as a design influence of ceramic pottery, often in the shape of vessels. The potato has since spread around the world and has become a staple crop in most countries.</p>

    <h2>Are Potatoes Healthy?</h2>

    <p>In addition to starch, potatoes contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They’re rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant. Potatoes were a life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C prevented scurvy. Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an electrolyte which aids in the workings of our heart, muscles, and nervous system. Potato skin contains fiber, which is important for digestive health.</p>
    <p>Different types of potatoes, especially those that come in other colors, contain more nutrients that have health benefits. In general, the darker the potato, the more antioxidants it contains. Sweet potatoes are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants including anthocyanins which may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.</p>
